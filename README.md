# Data Mining & Machine Learning: Portfolio Project (100%) #
### Project Overview: ### 
A portfolio which critically compares the performance of five different machine learning methods applied to 
three large datasets with a degree of relatability. 
The main focus being the identification of insights into the application of each machine learning method as well as the
application limitations.

## Proposed Research: ##
The research is interested in exploring variables which ultimately cause a delay and or cancellation to a given commercial
flights with the end goal of determining if weather variables have a direct cause for delays and or cancellations.
***Datasets:***
1. The first dataset outlines all recorded flight delays for the United States of America for the year of 2019 in conjunction to weather descriptions on an hourly basis for a single record. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
2. The second dataset outlines the daily and hourly measurements of weather from the JFK Airport weather station for the period of the 1st of January 2020 to the 31st of January 2021. This dataset is sourced from the NCEI, NOAA.
3. The third dataset outlines the daily and hourly measurements of weather from the LAX Airport weather station for the period of the 1st of January 2020 to the 31st of January 2021. This dataset is sourced from the NCEI, NOAA.

## Methodology: ##
The portfolio is produced using the KDD - Knowledge Discovery in Databases methodology.
